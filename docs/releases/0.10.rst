*Released: Not Yet Released*

This release is a polish release that is prepping us for the road to 1.0.

This release's major changes:

* Stator, the background task system, has been significantly reworked to require
  smaller indexes, spend less time scheduling, and has had most of its async
  nature removed, as this both reduces deadlocks and improves performance in
  most situations (the context switching was costing more than the gains from
  talking to other servers asynchronously).

* TBC

If you'd like to help with code, design, or other areas, see
:doc:`/contributing` to see how to get in touch.

You can download images from `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/jointakahe/takahe>`_,
or use the image name ``jointakahe/takahe:0.10``.


Upgrade Notes
-------------

Migrations
~~~~~~~~~~

There are new database migrations; they are backwards-compatible, but contain
very significant index changes to all of the main tables that may cause the
PostgreSQL deadlock detector to trigger if you attempt to apply them while your
site is live.

We recommend:

* Temporarily stopping all instances of the webserver and Stator
* Applying the migration (should be less than a few minutes on most installs)
* Restarting the instances of webserver and Stator
